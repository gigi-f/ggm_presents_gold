# Development Phases

Last updated: 2025-09-27

Recent changes (delta):
- Implemented shopkeeper with full-screen shop UI (wallet display, item pricing, pagination, A/D nav, C to close)
- Added modular enemy system with a bat enemy; enemies freeze during transitions and respect combat
- Smooth scroll transitions between maps; edge sensors/doors; input/physics locks
- Combat: melee swings with arc hit, enemy HP, knockback/stun, shield block, player i-frames, feedback FX
- Economy: wallet with denominations, pricing, spending; HUD currency counters
- Removed outdated bush/stump system (objects, collisions, chop logic)
- Added Pause Menu (ESC toggles; physics/tweens pause/resume; modal uses unified UI; registry-gated)
- Added basic Stamina system (HUD bar, regen, drains: shield hold + melee swing cost, auto-lower on 0)
- Added Mini-map overlay (M toggle, HUD-aligned, shows doors + player; non-blocking)
- Mini-map: fixed right-wall alignment; added enemies/NPC markers; efficient per-frame updates
- Save/Load: added simple localStorage save/load via Pause Menu (position, map, HP/stamina, wallet, inventory, equipment)
- Enemy variety: added Slime enemy (wander + chase)
- Mini-map does NOT reveal gold/currency spawns to preserve exploration
- Overworld Map overlay (O): grid of zones with fog-of-war; only visited tiles visible; highlights current tile; modal with input gating
- Combat polish: consistent knockback for enemies from hit origin; player knockback on enemy hit; stunned enemies now dampen to a stop (no camera shake)
- GitHub Pages fixes: Vite base set to repo path; index entry script uses relative path
