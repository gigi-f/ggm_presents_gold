# Development Phases

Last updated: 2025-09-27

Recent changes (delta):
- **MAJOR: Complete Audio Integration System** - AudioManager with music transitions, spatial SFX, volume controls
- **MAJOR: Character Animation System** - CharacterAnimator with state-based movement, attack, and hit animations  
- **MAJOR: Particle System** - Environmental effects, combat feedback, visual polish with 6 particle types
- Audio: Background music changes by map type (overworld, shop, cave); fade in/out transitions
- Audio: Sound effects for all player actions (swing, shield, hit, pickup) with spatial positioning
- Audio: Enemy sounds (hit, death) with distance-based volume falloff  
- Audio: UI sounds for menus, doors, shop purchases with audio feedback
- Audio: Settings dialog in pause menu with volume sliders (Master, Music, SFX) and audio toggle
- Audio: Persistent settings saved to localStorage; performance-optimized with sound instance limits
- Animations: Smooth player movement with directional bob effects and idle breathing
- Animations: Attack animations with wind-up, strike, and recoil based on direction
- Animations: Hit/damage animations with screen shake and color effects
- Particles: Combat hit effects, weapon trails, currency sparkles, enemy death explosions
- Particles: Environmental dust for atmosphere, optimized with lifecycle management (200 particle limit)
- Fixed shopkeeper persistence: always re-created on shop entry; cleaned stale references on map rebuild so the NPC never disappears
- Implemented shopkeeper with full-screen shop UI (wallet display, item pricing, pagination, A/D nav, C to close)
- Added modular enemy system with a bat enemy; enemies freeze during transitions and respect combat
- Smooth scroll transitions between maps; edge sensors/doors; input/physics locks
- Combat: melee swings with arc hit, enemy HP, knockback/stun, shield block, player i-frames, feedback FX
- Economy: wallet with denominations, pricing, spending; HUD currency counters
- Removed outdated bush/stump system (objects, collisions, chop logic)
- Added Pause Menu (ESC toggles; physics/tweens pause/resume; modal uses unified UI; registry-gated)
- Added basic Stamina system (HUD bar, regen, drains: shield hold + melee swing cost, auto-lower on 0)
- Added Mini-map overlay (M toggle, HUD-aligned, shows doors + player; non-blocking)
- Mini-map: fixed right-wall alignment; added enemies/NPC markers; efficient per-frame updates
- Save/Load: added simple localStorage save/load via Pause Menu (position, map, HP/stamina, wallet, inventory, equipment)
- Enemy variety: added Slime enemy (wander + chase)
- Mini-map does NOT reveal gold/currency spawns to preserve exploration
- Overworld Map overlay (O): grid of zones with fog-of-war; only visited tiles visible; highlights current tile; modal with input gating
- Combat polish: consistent knockback for enemies from hit origin; player knockback on enemy hit; stunned enemies now dampen to a stop (no camera shake)
- GitHub Pages fixes: Vite base set to repo path; index entry script uses relative path
